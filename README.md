# EngageEye

EngageEye is an application built with Python3, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It detects if the user is distracted through facial and landmark detection. If a user is distracted, the application will find a punishment for the user...

**I am currently working on implementing more robust features and learning more about Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and the algorithms involved with facial detection!**
